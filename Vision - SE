Repository for proof of participation and Capstone work
This is Stan.  

My current vision for the capstone project is TBD.  I will be reviewing and studying datasets  to choose what works for me. 
#Target: Data Analyst Project, stretch goal Data Scientist
#TODO - add link(s) to dataset source(s) when found.
I would like to use all the tools we have learned during this course. 
#TODO - pick first three technologies for layers storage/analysis/model and work through them first
More to follow.
