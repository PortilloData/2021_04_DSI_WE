# Kevin Crosby's Vision Statement - 2021_04_DSI_WE

## Goals
1. Data Preparation & Shaping (Power Query & maybe DAX)
1. Data Visualization & Insights (Power BI)
1. Power Automate for the Flows from Data Prep to the App or Dashboard that is going to consume the data
1. Giving a 10-15 minute PowerPoint Presentation to the President of Divergence Academy
1. Predictive ML Model (optional)

## Process in Determining Project
1. Review available datasets
1. Select datasets personally interesting to me
1. Narrow down datasets that answer an important business or research question or problem
1. Choose final dataset for project in which a predictive ML model can be built

### Brainstorming Ideas

- Space/Planet Related
  - Exoplanet discovery (NASA)
  - Locating water sources on Mars/other planets based on Earth data (computer vision)
  - Debris identification/tracking (computer vision)
  - Identifying potential damage on space flight vehicles (computer vision)

- Financial
  - Algorithmic Trading (time series ML)
  - Black-Scholes Model improvement (Graph Neural Network)
  - CBDC Adoption by Country

- NLP/NLU
  - Sentiment Analysis on Topic (social media, reviews, comments, etc.)
  - Language Detection?

- Computer Vision
  - Facial Recognition
  - Object Recognition (photo/video)
  - Handwriting Recognition (maybe with NLP?)

## 2021-07-11 (Preliminary)

My first instinct is to do a project in Computer Vision, although I have work experience in NLP/NLU, since this will
help diversify my skill set. I can leverage both Computer Vision and NLP by doing handwriting recognition, and there
are multiple data sources online, especially in Kaggle, that may need to be normalized and appended to each other in
Power BI. This is important for transcribing handwritten text into typed text for easier processing.

In theory, a supervised machine learning model can be created to predict the text of any handwritten document (in English).

My secondary and tertiary choices would be to do object/facial recognition, or algorithmic trading.
#Target: Data Scientist
#TODO - add link(s) to dataset source(s) when found.
#TODO - pick first three technologies for layers storage/analysis/model and work through them first
